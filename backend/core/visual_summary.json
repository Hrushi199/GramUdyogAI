            "text": "Bajra is ready to harvest about 60-70 days after sowing, when the grains are mature and dry. Farmers can harvest bajra by cutting the stalks near the base, and then threshing the grains to separate them from the chaff. Proper storage is essential to maintain the quality of the grains, and farmers can store bajra in a cool, dry place to preserve it for longer periods.",
